# SentimentAnalysis-AmazonReview
  Sentiment Analysis is the use of Natural Language Processing to systematically study, identify, extract and quantify the subjective information. A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level: whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral. This can be utilized for a feedback management system.

In this project, I have used the Kaggle Dataset: Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews.

The idea in this project is to classify the Reviews as Positive, Negative and Neutral to get a complete idea on feedback provided by customers.
